Part 1

Draw 1 circle with a 30mm diameter.  This will be the center of the tri-spinner
Draw 3 circles witha a 33mm diameter.  Place them anywhere around the center circle.
Use the polygon tool to create a triangle inside the center circle with the top pointing toward the top center of the circle
Move one of the remaining circles to the top point.  It should be straight above the center circle and intersect on the point of the triangle
Move the other two circles to the other two points of the triangle within the circle.  They should also intersect the center circle at the point.

Part 2

Draw a hexagon (6 sides) inside each of the three remaining cirles.  The top point should also be placed at the top of the circle.
Draw a second triangle inside the center circle.  It should be 90 degrees offset from the original triangle.
Use the arc tool to draw an arc from one point on the hexagon to the opposite point on the closest hexagon with the curve intersecting the poin of the triangle on the center circle.
