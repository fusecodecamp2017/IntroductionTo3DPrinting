Part 1

Draw a cirle with a diameter of 30mm
Draw two more circles with a diameter of 30mm
Place the circles on the same horizontal line but a few mm apart so they are not touching
Draw a perpendicular line from the top of the furthest left circle to the top of the furthest right circle.  This line should intersect the very top of the middle circle
Draw another perpendicular line on the bottom of the circles the same as the top line

Part 2

Draw a circle inside each of the three existing circles 22.1mm in diameter.  The center of the circle should start at the center of the existing circles
Use the trim function to remove the outside parts of the three circles but leave the far left and far right of the outermost circles.  This will create an elongated oval with three circles inside.
Use the move function to move the two outermost circles toward the center circle.  Ensure that the distance between the circles is equal.

Part 3
Use the extrude function to extrude the solid part of the spinner up 7.1mm.
Use the filet function to add a fillet to the top and bottom edge of the spinner.  It should be about a 2mm filet.

Part 4
Use the timeline feature to undo adding the filet to both the top and bottom
Use the text feature to add your name to the side of the spinner
Use the extrude feature to emboss your name on the side of the spinner
Use the timeline feature to redo the filet
