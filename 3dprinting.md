What Is 3D Printing?
====================

**
3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing. Objects are built in small layers, stacked on top of each other one at a time. It can be quite a slow process, but it does have many benefits. For comparison, a subtractive manufacturing process starts with a solid block of material, and removes bits until the final product is born. Some examples of this are marble sculpting and CNC milling (that’s computer numerical control). 3D printers are technically a type of CNC machine, but they are rarely referred to as such — it can get confusing!

Terminology
-----------

**
Before digging too deep into 3D printing, here is some common jargon you may encounter along the way.

Filament — A material (often plastic) manufactured into a long strand (like a cable). These are used by some types of 3D printers to manufacture objects.

Extruder — The part of the machine where the material is melted.
Nozzle — A small hole from which melted filament is pushed (“extruded”) out of.

Bed — The surface on which a 3D printed object is produced.

Heated Bed — A print surface that is heated to provide better adhesion.

Stepper Motor — A precise and powerful motor used to move the various parts of a printer.

RepRap — An open source 3D printer movement.

G-code — Instructions for a machine describing every movement required to manufacture a part. Not specific to 3D printing.

Slicer — A piece of software used to convert 3D models to G-code.

Axis — A reference line for movement. A 3 axis machine can move in X (left to right), Y (front to back), and Z (up and down).

Carriage — A moving part that the extruder sits on.

Types of Printers
-----------------

Now that you know what 3D printing is, let’s look at the different types of machine. There are two types of printing process: Fused Deposition Modelling and Stereolithography. These have their own strengths and weaknesses, so here are the basics.

Fused Deposition Modelling
--------------------------

Fused Deposition Modelling, or FDM, is the simplest and most popular method of printing. The printing material is pushed through a hot tube. This tube is pushed around to draw the required shape, just like piping a message onto a cake. The temperatures vary depending on the material, however 200C/392F is about average for consumer machines printing in plastic.

Stereolithography
-----------------

Stereolithography (SLA) is very different to FDM. This starts with a container of special liquid plastic (known as photopolymer resin). An ultraviolet laser is directed at the top of the resin, causing it to solidify (not the whole lot, just a small layer). Just like FDM, each layer is “drawn” and cured successively. These machines work from the top down, pulling the object out from the liquid.


Cartesian
---------

Much like a traditional inkjet or laser printer, cartesian machines are fairly straightforward. They have an X-axis, Y-axis, and a Z-axis, with one or more stepper motors to drive each one. They will have a square or rectangular bed, and it would not be uncommon to have the entire bed move in one axis.

Delta
-----

Delta printers also utilize X, Y, and Z axis, however there is one important difference. Delta machines suspend the extruder from three arms in a triangle arrangement. They will nearly always have a circular print bed that does not move. These machines were designed to print parts fast!

Printing Materials
------------------

Just as there are hundreds of different printer styles, sizes, and prices, there are dozens of printing materials (filament for FDM machines). The main two you should focus on right now are ABS and PLA. There are other materials gaining popularity (Nylon for high strength, and wood-based for different textures), however these are not always as simple to use.

Polylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable plastic derived from renewable resources, such as sugarcane or corn starch. As a result, printing with it gives off a semi-sweet smell. It is one of the easiest materials to print with, while still maintaining high strength. PLA can be “stringy,” making it prone to clogging. Ensure you follow any and all manufacturer recommendations.
ABS, or Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, is the stuff Lego bricks are made from. Derived from fossil fuels, it is strong, and hard wearing. It is not biodegradable, and printing with it can give off a strong “burning plastic” smell. While it can be challenging to print with, it is still one of the more popular material choices. A heated bed is often required to prevent warping and poor bed adhesion. Parts printed with ABS can be sanded and smoothed quite easily.
Both PLA and ABS can be purchased in a wide variety of colors. PLA can be found in partially translucent colors if required.
